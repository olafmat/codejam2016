## My training and submissions to the Google Code Jam 2016 competition and its spin-off Distributed Google Code Jam 2016

It was a huge international algorithmic competition. 

In the 2016 edition, there were 58,520 registrants and 27,154 participants who solved at least one problem in the Qualification Round. I made it to the Distributed Round 2 (one level below the Grand Final in New York), where I came 198th.
