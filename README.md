## My training and submissions to the Google Code Jam 2016 competition and its spin-off Distributed Google Code Jam 2016

It's a massive international programming contest. In the 2016 edition there were 58,520 registrants, and 27,154 contestants with at least one solved problem in the Qualification Round. I managed to advance to the Distributed Round 2 (one level below the grand finals in New York) where I took 198th place.
